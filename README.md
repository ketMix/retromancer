Ebitengine Game Jam 2023

## Customization
If you want to override anything, create an assets directory next to the executable and the game will prefer the contents of that directory over the built-in ones. An example would be to add your own gamepad to the `gamepad.yaml` files in the event your button and axis keybinds don't work out of the box.
